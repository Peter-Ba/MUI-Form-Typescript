# ConnectsYa Form Builder

Note - I have named this ConnectsYa in effort to keep it public but not easily searchable by future candidates.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriswillsflannery/MUI-Form-Typescript.git
cd MUI-Form-Typescript
npm i
npm start
```

## Running Test Suite

```bash
npm run test
```

## Libraries

Note - included libraries have intentionally been kept light. You will notice there is no form validation library or typescript schema validation library. This is by design.

-  Components/Styling: [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
-  Unit Testing: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
-  Unit Testing: [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Timezone API Source

Note - I have included a developer's comment in the TimeZone component.
